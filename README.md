# Potato Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify various diseases in potato leaves. Leveraging the PlantVillage dataset, the model is trained to classify images into distinct disease categories, assisting in the early detection and management of potato plant diseases.

## Description

The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model using TensorFlow that can accurately classify potato leaf images into categories such as healthy or diseased, with specific diseases like early blight and late blight. The dataset consists of thousands of labeled images, which are used to train and validate the model.

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: The model achieved an accuracy of **96%** on the test set.
- **Test Loss**: The test loss attained by the model is **0.045**.
